## Core Skills

### 1. **CSV to Database Conversion**

- **Capability**: Upload CSV files directly and convert them to SQLite databases
- **How it works**: User uploads a CSV file in the chat window, the agent processes it and creates an SQLite database
- **Features**:
  - Automatic file upload handling
  - CSV parsing and validation
  - Dynamic table creation based on CSV structure
  - Column type inference
  - Data verification and row counting
  - Support for any CSV file structure
- **Safety feature**: Validates CSV format before conversion
- **Output**: Returns database statistics including record count, column count, and column names

### 2. **Natural Language to SQL Translation**

- **Capability**: Convert human questions directly into valid SQLite queries
- **How it works**: Uses Claude AI to understand user intent and generate syntactically correct SQL
- **Supported operations**:
  - SELECT queries with WHERE clauses
  - Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - GROUP BY for grouped analysis
  - ORDER BY for sorting and ranking
  - JOIN operations for related data
  - Date-based filtering and analysis
  - LIMIT for result pagination
- **Safety feature**: Only allows SELECT statements; blocks dangerous keywords (DROP, DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, CREATE, TRUNCATE)

### 3. **Database Query Execution**

- **Capability**: Safely execute generated SQL queries against SQLite database
- **Features**:
  - Read-only query enforcement
  - SQL validation before execution
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Query result formatting
  - Support for up to 20 rows display with "more rows" indication
- **Data handling**: Converts query results to pandas DataFrames for analysis

### 4. **SQL Query Validation & Safety**

- **Capability**: Protect database from harmful operations
- **Validation checks**:
  - Query must start with SELECT
  - Blocks forbidden keywords (DROP, DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, CREATE, TRUNCATE)
  - SQLite syntax validation
  - Error reporting for invalid queries
- **Benefit**: Safe execution even with untrusted queries

### 5. **Data Analysis & Insights Generation**

- **Capability**: Translate raw data into business-friendly insights
- **Analysis includes**:
  - Direct answers to user questions
  - Key patterns and trends identification
  - Outlier and anomaly detection
  - Statistical insights with percentages
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Notable correlations in data
- **Output style**: Professional yet conversational

### 6. **Schema Introspection**

- **Capability**: Automatically understand database structure
- **Features**:
  - Extracts table schema (column names and types)
  - Retrieves sample data for context
  - Provides column information to AI for better query generation
  - Supports dynamic schema adaptation
- **Benefit**: Works with any customer order dataset structure

### 7. **Data Formatting & Presentation**

- **Capability**: Display results in clear, readable formats
- **Formats supported**:
  - Markdown tables
  - Structured data visualization
  - Streaming display with progressive updates
  - Row count indicators
  - Readable number formatting
- **User experience**: Shows query progress step-by-step
